# General-Bluetooth-Remote-control-for-spider
Making a bluetooth hardware project is one thing, but creating an app for controling the bluetooth project is a seperate thing. It takes time and effort. So to bypass that development time and effort i decided to make a generic universal Bluetooth application to control all types of bluetooth projects. This way the hardware developer can simply download the application and use it instead of developing a new application for the same purpose entirely. 

# Aim 
I plan on making a generic bluetooth remote control app for controlling all possible bluetooth projects that a developer might make.

# Progress
This project is still a work in progress.
